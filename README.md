# Pandas Challenge / PySchool Challenge

In this notebook, different public and private schools are compared against each other on a number of factors, including population, budget, spend-per-student and standardized test results. The analysis of the data, showed the following:

* Charter schools had a lower population and lower spend per student, but performed significantly better than the public schools.

* The larger the school, the lower the performance - particularly in the overall passing rate which showed significant underperformance the larger the school was.

* Schools with higher budgets did not correlate to higher passing rates, but the inverse did seem to be true - lower spend per student schools performed better. However, the lower-spend schools were all charter schools, which performed better overall.

* Somewhere in the data, there appears to be a discrepency in the 11th grade reading score, which was exactly the same for each school.
